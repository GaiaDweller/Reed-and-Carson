# Requirements and Specifications

## The Game  
The game will be a simple top-down shooter where the player is able to control the orientation and position of the main character (a spaceship). Asteroids will be slowly heading toward the player from all directions, and the player will be able to shoot them to make them disappear. If one of these asteroids hits the player, they will lose a life. There will also be power-ups the player will be able to collect by touching them, which will temporarily give them abilities. These will include a spread shot, a clear-all-asteroids-on-screen ability, and a faster rate of fire. Each of these will need to last ten seconds. Finally, the player will have three lives (they can be hit three times before losing).  

## Requirements  
This game will need to be formatted as an app we can put out on storefronts such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Steam Store, and the Microsoft Store. It will need to be formatted for both computers and phones. This will require two different builds of the game with different controller schemes. We also want the game to keep track of your highest score, and we want a global leaderboard that you can submit your scores to, so our players can compare their scores.  

## Specifications  
For our PC controller scheme, WASD will control location, and it will not be completely independent from orientation; orientation will be decided based on the mouse's location. The spaceship will always face toward the mouse, and the player can use the left mouse button to fire. For the mobile version, a digital control stick will need to be implemented to control location, and the ship will face whatever direction the other finger is pointing. The ship will also automatically fire when you have your right finger on the screen. We will need to have a small server to store the game leaderboards, and each copy of the game will need a small file to save its current high score.
